Implemented in vanilla JS only without any other JS frameworks or libraries.

Here's what **Dynamic List** does

- It will load only **30 items** but will display more up to **100** by scroll event.
- A hovered item in the list shifts **40px** right.
- The items right up and down of the hovered item shift **20px** right.
- Should return the position when other item is hovered.
- If you click a item in the list, the clicked DOM should resize itself to pop out.
- Should be able to close the popped out DOM by clicking outside of the popup area.
